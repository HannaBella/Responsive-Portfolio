                Virginia became my second home. I start my life from the scratch and set diffrent carrier path which was totally out of my league yet interesting and challenging. I became full time IT student in Northern Virginia Community Colleage (NOVA) and full time
                Airline employee. I graduated with the highest distinction (summa cum laude) and I've five plus years of extensive experience as ticketing and passenger service agent. After graduation, I got married and moved to San Diego, California.
